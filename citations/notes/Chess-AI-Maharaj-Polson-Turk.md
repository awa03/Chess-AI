### Useful Information for this Project
- Attempting to test my model with Plasketts puzzle will be an effective way of gauging the performance of the model. Since the depth required to solve the puzzle is 15 moves, as well as the need for underpromotion.
-  Stockfish heavily relies on alpha-beta search. 
    - Would be fairly easy to implement, but im really hoping to make a neural network, but this would be a good option for a starting point. Or minimax
